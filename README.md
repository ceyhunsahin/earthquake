# earthquake

After the devastating earthquake that occurred on February 6th, 2023 in Turkey,
I wanted to plot the regions and places in Turkey. Using Dash Plotly, 
I developed a small project that displays the earthquakes that Turkey has 
experienced in the last 4 years using mapbox and leaflet, and shows the 
earthquake information for selected city and town in both graphical and dash_
table format and finally ChatGPT was added :)
